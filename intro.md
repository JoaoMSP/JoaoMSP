Hello, world!<br>
  My name's João Marcelo (you can call me John) and this is my GitHub page!<br>
  I've studied chemistry at Mackenzie, a university located in São Paulo/Brazil.<br>
  But, unfortunately, never found success in this carrer path. Through the support provided from family and friends, I started going to an IT course in my home town and studying all sorts of coding languages.<br>
  I'm very eager to learn more and to start a carrer as a developer.<br>
  Feel free to contact me at jmarcelosacchi12@gmail.com if you have any suggestions or just want to talk.<br>
  I'm still trying to learn how GitHub works, but already uploaded some of the projects I've worked on using HTML.<br>

  <strong>Welcome to my page!</strong>
